## Introduction To Data Structures

*Data Structures are the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer.*

*Data structures are the main part of computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. it plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.*

### Types of Data Structure

#### data structures are divided into two categories:


* **Linear Data Structure**: *A linear data structure has data elements connected to each other so that elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to the element in front of it and behind it. This way, the structure can be traversed in a single run.*

*and some examples of linear Data Structure are: Array, Linked list, Stack, Queue*

### Example of Data structures are:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Sets
* Maps
* Binary Trees
* Heaps
* Graphs
