# Stacks Data structure

*Stack is a linear data structure which follows a praticular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO ( Last In First Out ) or FILO ( First In Last Out ).*

**Example of Stacks Data structure**

**Three Basic operations in the stacks:**

* Push: Adds an item in stack
* pop: Removes top item of stack
* Peek: Returns top item of stack

*An everyday analogy of a stacks data structure is a stack of books on a desk, Stack of plates, table tennis ...etc*

**Example of Stacks Data structure In Real Life**

**Following is the various application of stack in data structure:**

* Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions
* Backtracking
* Delimiter Checking
* Processing Function Calls

**Time Complexities of operations on stack:**

*push(), pop(), peek() and isEmpty() all take O(1) time. because we do not run any for loop in any of these operations.*
