# Data Structures in JavaScript

## Introduction To Data Structures

*Data Structures are the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer.*

*Data structures are the main part of computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. it plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.*

### Example of Data structures are:

* Arrays
* Linked lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Sets
* Maps
* Binary Trees
* Heaps
* Graphs

> ### The Completed Data Structures Branches:

* [Stacks](https://github.com/sidiDev/data-structures/tree/stacks)

### Stacks Data structure

*Stack is a linear data structure which follows a praticular order in which the operations are performed . The order may be LIFO ( Last In First Out ) or FILO ( First In Last Out ).*

**Example of Stacks Data structure**

**Three basic operations in the stacks are**:

* Push: Adds an item in the stack
* pop: Removes top item of the stack
* Peek: Returns top item of the stack
* IsEmpty: Returns true if stack is empty, else false
